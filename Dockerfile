# Add a user.
#
# Docker's _Security_ guide has a [Conclusions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#conclusions) section that recommends, for added security, configuring a non-root user to run commands.
#
# With a `hutson` user configured the `hutson` user can be accessed by passing `--user hutson` to `docker run`.
#
# Some background on Docker security best practices - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/docker-user/e9RkC4y-21E/JOZF8H-PfYsJ
RUN adduser --group --shell /bin/sh hutson

# Switch to the `hutson` user for all subsequent commands. Configuring the `USER` also causes all commands executed by `docker run` to run as the `hutson` user by default.
USER hutson:hutson

# Set the working directory for future commands that need to operate on the file system, or as the starting directory when a user logs into a container based on this image.
WORKDIR /home/hutson

# Instruct Docker that the following directory may contain externally mounted volumes from the host system, or other containers.
# Any files already existing within the following directory are copied into the mounted volume.
# Mounting the current directory from the host system, for the purpose of development, is usually done by running the following:
# > docker run --volume "$(pwd)":/home/hutson <IMAGE NAME>
VOLUME /home/hutson
